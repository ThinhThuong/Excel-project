# Bike Sale Data Analysis (using Excel)
## Introduction:
This report presents a data analysis conducted on a dataset containing information about bike sales over a one-year period. 
## Dataset: 
<a href="https://github.com/ThinhThuong/Excel-project/blob/main/1.%20Project%20Bike%20Sales.xlsx">Bike Sale</a> The dataset comprises 1027 rows (including a header row) and 13 columns.

## Objective:
To identify potential target markets and ideal customer profiles to optimize sales strategies and attract more customers.

## Question:
1. Which region has the highest bike sales?
2. How does average income affect the decision to buy a bike?
3. Is there a relationship between commute distance and bike purchases?
4. Which age range has the highest number of bike buyers?

## Process:
### 1. Eliminate Duplicate Records
Start by removing duplicate rows to ensure the dataset is clean and accurate for analysis.

### 2. Simplify Confusing Values
Replace ambiguous values in the columns “Marital Status” and “Gender” for better readability:
- Convert M to Married and S to Single.
- Convert F to Female and M to Male.
Example: Change M in Marital Status to Married for clarity.

### 3. Group Age into Categories
Simplify the continuous Age feature by grouping it into meaningful categories:
- Adolescent (<31 years)
- Middle Age (31–54 years)
- Old (>54 years)
- Invalid (if age falls outside these ranges)

Add a new column, “Age Bracket”, to store these categories for enhanced interpretability.

### 4. Create Pivot Tables for Insights
- Dedicate a separate sheet for pivot tables to facilitate easy updates and adjustments.
- Build pivot tables based on specific questions and outline the key metrics.
- Lay the groundwork for a simple dashboard to present data interactively.

### 5. Design an Interactive Dashboard
- Create a dedicated sheet for the dashboard.
- Incorporate slicers to filter variables dynamically and uncover deeper insights.
- Format the dashboard and slicers with a cohesive and professional theme to enhance visual appeal.

## Answer the questions:
1. Which region has the highest bike sales?
- North America has the highest bike sales, followed by Europe and the Pacific.
- In the Pacific and North America, males tend to buy more bikes than females, whereas in Europe, women purchase more bikes than men.
2. How does average income affect the decision to buy a bike?
- People who purchase bikes tend to have a significantly higher income than those who do not buy bikes, for both females and males.
- The average income for female bike buyers is nearly $55,700, while the average income for male bike buyers is about $60,000.
3. Is there a relationship between commute distance and bike purchases?
- Most people who buy bikes have a commute distance of 0-1 miles.
- People with a commute distance of 5 miles or more tend to avoid purchasing bikes.
4. Which age range has the highest number of bike buyers?
- The middle-aged group (31-54 years) has a significantly higher number of bike buyers compared to non-buyers.
- In other age groups (adolescents and older adults), the number of people who do not buy bikes is higher than those who do.

## Recommendations:
- Target regions with lower sales potential: Given the high sales in North America, explore strategies to increase bike sales in regions like Europe and the Pacific, where there are gender-based purchasing differences.
- Tailor marketing to income segments: Since higher income correlates with bike purchases, focus marketing efforts on individuals with disposable income. Highlight bikes as a practical and efficient investment, particularly in affluent areas.
- Promote convenience for short commutes: Emphasize the benefits of bikes for shorter commutes, especially in urban areas, where biking can be a more efficient and eco-friendly alternative to cars.
Develop products and services for middle-aged buyers: As middle-aged individuals are the largest group of bike buyers, consider offering bikes and related products that cater to their lifestyle, including comfortable designs, easy maintenance, and convenience for commuting.
